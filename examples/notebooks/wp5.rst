Progress in WP5
===============

We are currently working on D5.3, Cost functions for the provision of ancillary services.

D5.3 must be issued by 30/08/2019, in august, so the objective is to circulate the first draft among the partners during june in order to receive comments and to prepare a final draft in july.

We have already received the following contributions:

1. Contribution of AUTH (voltage regulation, high frequency power smoothing and fault clearing)
2. Contribution of FENECON (low frequency power smoothing), commented by AUTH (Kostas)
3. Contribution of USE (Inertia response)
4. ICT costs, provided by Lancaster and Passau.

Contributions still pending:

1. Literature review on cost-functions to provide ancillary services (TUDelft)
2. USE (harmonic mitigation, black start capability and primary frequency response)

We have started integrating the received contributions in order to prepare the first draft to be circulated for comments.
